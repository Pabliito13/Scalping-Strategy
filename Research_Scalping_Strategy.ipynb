    "This notebook presents an analysis of a scalping strategy applied to gold futures (GC), tested over the last 30 days from March 04, 2025, to April 14, 2025, using 1-minute timeframe data retrieved via the Interactive Brokers API. This research is a variant of my primary scalping strategy, which employs a broader set of indicators. Here, I focus specifically on two indicators to simplify the approach and evaluate its effectiveness. The objective is to assess the strategy’s performance through key metrics like total return, drawdown, and risk-adjusted returns, emphasizing results and insights over implementation details."

    "## Strategy Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant of my main scalping strategy leverages two technical indicators, unlike the broader set used in the primary approach:\n",
    "- **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: An 8-period SMA serves as an exit signal for single-position trades.\n",
    "- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: A 10-period RSI triggers long entries when it drops below 30, indicating an oversold condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy initiates a long position with a fixed size of 1 contract whenever RSI < 30. Additional positions are opened if the price falls 2 USD below an existing entry, allowing accumulation. Exit conditions depend on the number of open positions:\n",
    "- For a single position, it closes when the price touches the 8-period SMA.\n",
    "- For multiple positions, all close when the price reaches the average entry price plus 1 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy was backtested with an initial capital of 100,000 USD, aiming to exploit short-term price movements in the gold futures market using this simplified two-indicator framework."

    "The dataset comprises 1-minute historical data for the most active gold futures contract (GCM5), sourced from Interactive Brokers. It spans 30 days, from March 04, 2025, to April 14, 2025, and includes open, high, low, and close prices. The total number of observations is inferred from the 587 trades executed during the test period."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtest assessed the following performance metrics:\n",
    "1. **Total Return**: Percentage gain in equity from the initial $100,000 capital.\n",
    "2. **Maximum Realized Drawdown**: The largest net equity drop below the starting capital.\n",
    "3. **Maximum Intraday Drawdown**: The largest single-day equity decline from its intraday peak, reflecting daily risk.\n",
    "4. **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return, annualized using daily returns with no risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily results tracked initial balance, end-of-day equity, net profit/loss (PnL), and intraday drawdown. Additionally, the strategy was compared to a Buy and Hold approach—holding one gold futures contract for the entire period—though this may not be an ideal benchmark for a scalping strategy due to its short-term focus."

The 0.00% realized drawdown confirms that the exit rules effectively protected the initial capital. However, the maximum intraday drawdown of -\\$8247.00 on April 07, 2025, highlights significant short-term risk, likely due to price volatility during position accumulation early in the period.\n",

For comparison, a Buy and Hold approach—holding one gold futures contract for the entire period—was considered."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This scalping strategy, a variant of the main trading strategy, has demonstrated impressive performance over the last 30 days, achieving a 17.90% return with strong risk-adjusted metrics. Compared to the primary strategy, which incorporates additional indicators to provide more robust confirmation for market entries, this variant uses a streamlined set of indicators (EMA, RSI, ATR) for faster execution. However, the significant drawdown on April 7, 2025, during a market selloff underscores the need for caution in bearish conditions. By incorporating a market regime filter and further stress-testing, the strategy can become more resilient while maintaining its profitability. Traders are advised to monitor market conditions closely and consider pausing the strategy during strong short-selling periods. Potential enhancements include:\n",
    "- Capping the number of accumulated positions to limit exposure.\n",
    "- Adding a stop-loss to reduce intraday drawdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the Buy and Hold strategy, the scalping approach offers superior flexibility and frequency of returns, though the comparison is limited by their differing objectives. This backtest provides a solid foundation for further optimization and potential live implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future updates to this notebook may include code to implement the proposed regime filter and enhanced backtesting procedures."
