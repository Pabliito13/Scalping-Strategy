# Scalping Strategy Analysis

This project contains an in-depth analysis of a **scalping strategy** based on multiple technical indicators. The Jupyter Notebook (`strategy.ipynb`) performs the following:

- **Sharpe Ratio calculation** to measure risk-adjusted returns.
- **Cumulative Product** and **Cumulative Sum** to analyze the performance and growth of the portfolio over time.
- Utilizes various technical indicators, including **Bollinger Bands**, **Moving Averages**, **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**, **ATR (Average True Range)**, and **chart patterns** to inform trading decisions.

## Description

The project uses historical market data and technical indicators to evaluate the performance of a scalping strategy. It incorporates several key metrics to assess risk and returns, such as the **Sharpe Ratio**, while also providing visualizations for better understanding of cumulative returns.

### Key Features
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Calculates risk-adjusted return to assess the efficiency of the strategy.
- **Cumulative Product & Sum**: Visualizes portfolio growth and total gains over time.
- **Technical Indicators**: 
  - **Bollinger Bands**: To capture volatility and potential entry/exit points.
  - **Moving Averages**: To identify trends and signals.
  - **RSI**: For measuring overbought or oversold conditions.
  - **ATR**: To assess market volatility.
  - **Chart Patterns**: Used to predict future price movements.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting graphs.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations and handling array operations.
